WS-Trust is a WS-* specification that provides extensions to the WS-Security specification. WS-Security provides the basic framework for message level security in web services. WS-Trust builds on that base to specify a framework for broker trust across different security domains. It specifically deals with the issuing, renewing, and validating of security tokens, as well as with ways to establish, assess the presence of, and broker trust relationships between participants in a secure message exchange. 

This project focuses on implementing the WS-Trust specification for the WSO2 Identity Server 6.0.0 by simply integrating with Apache CXF.
